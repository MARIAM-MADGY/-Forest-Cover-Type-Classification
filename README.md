# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification
A machine learning project that predicts forest cover types from cartographic and environmental features using classification models.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Collected and preprocessed the UCI Covertype dataset.
- Handled categorical features, missing values, and performed data cleaning.
- Built and trained a Decision Tree classifier to handle multi-class prediction.
- Visualized results using a confusion matrix and feature importance plots.
- Evaluated performance with accuracy and classification metrics.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Compare performance with Logistic Regression and other advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Apply techniques like SMOTE to handle potential class imbalance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: core language  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: model building and evaluation
